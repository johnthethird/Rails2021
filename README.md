# Rails 2021

This is a Rails app, with my favorite Gems and ways of doing things. Use it as a base to get started on your own app.

## Live Demo

Check it out at Heroku https://gentle-caverns-84674.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

## Front End

- Use [HAML](https://haml.info/tutorial.html) as a better way to write HTML
- Redo the file system structure so that there is a `frontend` directory, with all JS and CSS in it, served by Webpack
- Use [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a CSS framework to build on
- Use [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org) as lightweight, easy ways to do Javascript things.

## User Logins

- Use [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0) for user logins. Allows for using Google to log in to our site.

## Misc

- Use [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for storing API keys etc, instead of stock Rails Credentials.
